# SER (Speech Emotion Recognition) for Automated Rating System

Dedicated customer service agents continually goes above and beyond to help clients, making an effort to solve concerns. Top-level management finds a critical need for a sophisticated tool to assess the performance of these agents as part of their effort to improve the quality of service delivery. The traditional method of performance evaluation entails the laborious task of manually examining recorded calls, a tedious task that presents major difficulties.

We propose Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), a cutting-edge solution that makes use of the power of in-person customer service encounters, to transform this process. 

Our ground-breaking solution includes a smart bot that analyzes the speech emotions spoken during these conversations and generates automated ratings based on the emotional content of the dialogue. The solution promises to streamline and improve the accuracy of agent performance assessment by automating the evaluation process, which will ultimately result in more effective and efficient customer service.
